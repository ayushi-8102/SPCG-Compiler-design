# SPCG-Compiler-design
The project involved the development of a comprehensive toolset that is capable of taking in a C program and performing a series of complex operations on it. The toolset consists of three main components: a scanner, a parser, and a code generator.

The scanner is responsible for analyzing the input program and breaking it down into its constituent parts, known as tokens. These tokens are then passed on to the parser, which uses them to construct a detailed symbol table that provides a complete representation of the program's structure and semantics.

Once the symbol table has been constructed, the parser applies LL(1) grammar to it in order to create a formal representation of the program's syntax. This representation can then be used by the code generator to generate target code that is compatible with the original C program.

Throughout the process, the toolset is designed to report any error or warning messages that may arise, ensuring that the final output is accurate and free of defects. Overall, the project represents a significant achievement in the field of software development, demonstrating the power and flexibility of modern programming languages and tools.
